# VBnet-python
 Convert a python project to VB.NET code

Requirements
Take a csv file as input in a VB.net program.
Output a xml file that has all the data that was in the csv file.
The program should be able to take multiple csv files as input, but that may not need to be in the first version.

There is a python program that has been written to do this.  The python program does not have many comments.  The python program is "csvtoxml" - in the Chamini folder.
The folder "MultipleCSVsToXML" has another python program called "multiple_csvtoxml" which is probably an improved version that is able to take multiple csv files.

It looks like the csv files need to be taken from the folder called "csvFinalOutput".  There are 2 csv files in that folder.

In the folder "MultipleCSVsToXML", there is a Word document called "Working Procedure".

"Import Sanctioned Party Specifications" - has the list of xml elements
"Working Procedure" - a Word file that says "Steps to convert the JMOF CSV files to XML"
1. create folders
2. create a text file called config
3. list of folders
4. combine csv files to csvFinalOutput and convert combined CSV to XML
5. Logs folder should have a file describing each conversion
